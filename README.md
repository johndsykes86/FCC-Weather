# FCC-Weather app

## So what is it?
This is a weather app that should grab your location based on HTML5's geolocation API and feed you what the current weather is.

## Installation?
There's no installation required. You should be able to clone or fork the project and run locally.

## What did you use to build it?
- [Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com)  
- [FreeCodeCamp's Weather API](https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me)  
- [HTML Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation)

## It's not working. You broke it.
I probably did break it. But just to make sure that it's not something I did, make sure you allow location to be captured if prompted. If you have any other questions or issues, please contact me via github or [email](mailto://hireme@mrjsykes.com)
